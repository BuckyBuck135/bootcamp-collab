## :question: What is this?

ðŸ‘‰ Many self-taught developers learn to code by themselves by reading or watching tutorials and coding along with them. Hopefully before long, they start building their own solo projects.

ðŸ‘‰ Many projects are performed in team settings with multiple developers. To get this experience outside of a job, _open-source projects are the way to go._ However, it can be intimidating to get involved with these projects if you are a first-timer! It may feel  difficult to know *how* you could contribute? How do you contribute to *someone else's* project?

---

Bootcamp Collaborative Webpage (better name?? ðŸ˜…) aims to make the experience of collaborating on group projects and contributing to open source beginner-friendly. You can make any kind of contribution, no matter how small or big. To keep it simple, we will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript - no frameworks or libraries. Therefore, getting started isn't very complicated, and if you need help just reach out in the Discord!

What you can contribute to this project?

ðŸ‘‰ *Anything!*

*Seriously!* You can add a link to another website/project you're working on. Change the background color. Make a list of your favorite foods. Add an interrobang to this `readme` file. Add a link to a cool coding resource. You can also take a look at Issues - see if there is one you want to take on, or one that you'd like to add 

**Get involved, make mistakes, and break things.**

We're all learning here and like many things in the coding world, you learn best by *doing*. So do!

## :hammer: Getting Started

There can be a lot to learn when getting involved in open-source projects if you've never contributed before. If you already know some HTML, you should be able to get started here by learning a little bit about Git and Github. Git is version control software, if you do a web search you should find a lot of resources to get you started.

Do you already know about these things? Here is a [great article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-start-opensource-contributions/) to get you started with forking a repository and creating a pull request. If you are comfortable reading documentation, Github is pretty accessible and they have a good section on [working collaboratively](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models) that is worth a read.

## Code of Conduct

Be nice, be patient, be helpful. Everyone here is learning and doing their best. Briefly read the [Open Source Etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette) if this is your first time with Open Source.
